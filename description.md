Create QR codes for each product and display them on your store for receiving payments Offline

LNbits Offline Shop allows for merchants to receive Bitcoin payments while offline and without any electronic device.

Merchant will create items and associate a QR code (a LNURLp) with a price. He can then print the QR codes and display them on their shop. When a customer chooses an item, scans the QR code, gets the description and price. After payment, the customer gets a confirmation code that the merchant can validate to be sure the payment was successful.

Customers must use an LNURL pay capable wallet.
